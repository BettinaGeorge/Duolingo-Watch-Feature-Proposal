# Duolingo’s Watch Feature Proposal  

This project was created as part of my application for the **Duolingo Thrive Associate Product Manager Program**. The goal was to design a new feature or reimagine an existing one to address an unmet need for Duolingo learners. My proposal, **The Watch Feature**, integrates entertainment and language learning for an engaging user experience.

## 🚀 Overview  

The **Watch Feature** is a proposed addition to Duolingo's "Skill Practice" section. This feature would act as a hub where users could watch authentic movies and shows integrated with bilingual subtitles and interactive annotations, offering a fun and immersive way to learn languages.

## 🧠 Problem Statement  

Many learners struggle with:  
- Retaining vocabulary effectively.  
- Finding engaging, real-world practice opportunities.  

This unmet need often leads to reduced engagement and slower progress in language acquisition.

## 💡 Proposed Solution  

The **Watch Feature** bridges this gap by providing users with:  
1. **Localized Content**: Authentic movies and shows from native-speaking regions to immerse users in cultural context.  
2. **Dual Subtitles**: Customizable subtitles in the target and native languages to adapt to learners' needs.  
3. **Interactive Tools**: Pin words/phrases and save clips for personalized review.  
4. **Integrated Review Section**: Flashcards, saved clips, and vocabulary games to reinforce learning.  

### 📌 Key Benefits  
- **Cultural Immersion**: Learn languages in context through native media.  
- **Enhanced Vocabulary Practice**: Connect vocabulary with meaningful, memorable experiences.  
- **Increased Engagement**: Blend entertainment and learning for longer app sessions and improved retention.

## 📊 Validation and Testing  

### Hypothesis Validation  
- Users who engage with the “Watch” feature will spend more time on the app and demonstrate improved vocabulary retention.  

### A/B Testing Plan  
- **Group A**: Full “Watch” feature experience (dual subtitles, pinning, and review tools).  
- **Group B**: Standard Duolingo experience.  

### Metrics to Track  
- **Engagement**: Time spent on the “Watch” feature.  
- **Retention**: Frequency of app return among “Watch” users.  
- **Learning Progress**: Vocabulary recall improvement through quizzes.  
- **Pin Usage**: Frequency of pinning and revisiting saved items.  

### Pilot Testing  
- Launch the feature to intermediate learners in popular languages (e.g., Spanish, Korean) to gauge interest and usability.
